 UNIT 80 IS NOW ASSIGNED TO: E59419\DAT.TXT
 |_*THIS IS THE FILE DAT.TXT WHICH CONSTRUCTS THE CANADIAN DATA FOR 1960-2018.
 |_*DATA CONSTRUCTED JUNE 2, 2019.
 |_*WHEN A LINE HAS AN * IN THE FIRST POSITION, SHAZAM IGNORES THE RESULTING STATEMENT
 |_*BUT THESE STATEMENTS WITH A * EXPLAIN WHAT THE PROGRAM IS TRYING TO DO.WHEN YOU HAVE A JOB AS AN ECONOMIST,
 |_*YOU WILL HAVE TO DOCUMENT YOUR PROGRAMS. THE * MATERIAL ENABLES YOU TO EXPLAIN TO OTHERS (AND YOURSELF)
 |_*WHAT YOU ARE DOING IN THE PROGRAM. DOCUMENTATION OF YOUR PROGRAM IS OF PRIMARY IMPORTANCE IN THE REAL WORLD.
 |_*I HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN WHAT THE PROGRAM IS TRYING TO DO IN THESE STATEMENTS PRECEDED BY AN *
 |_*I HAVE USED INFORMATION FROM OECD.STAT PLUS SOME EARLIER OECD HARD COPY PUBLICATIONS IN
 |_*ORDER TO GENERATE DATA FOR THE 1960S PLUS SOME STATISTICS CANADA INFORMATION TO UPDATE THE DATA TO 2016.
 |_*THE OUTPUT FILE IS SHAZAMW\E59419\DATOUT.TXT. YOUR TITLES FOR THE INPUT AND OUTPUT FILES WILL BE DIFFERENT.
 |_*NATIONAL ACOUNTS DATA ARE AVAILABLE IN VARIOUS LIBRARY PUBLICATIONS; SEE
 |_*MAIN AGGREGATES: 1960-1997; OECD; PARIS; 1999 (HC 79 I5 O751 ) (I WILL MAKE AN ELECTRONIC COPY AVAILABLE FOR YOU).
 |_*TO GET SOME INFORMATION FOR THE 1960S, YOU WILL NEED TO GO TO THE UBC LIBRARY AND SEARCH FOR HARD COPIES
 |_*OF THE OECD MAIN AGGREGATES FOR THE 1970s WHICH HAVE ANNUAL DATA FOR THE 1960s IN THEM.
 |_*HOWEVER THE MAIN AGGREGATES: 1960-1997; OECD; PARIS; 1999 VOLUME HAS INFORMATION ON
 |_*C+G+I+X-M IN CURRENT AND CONSTANT DOLLARS FOR THE 1960'S.
 |_*THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE A EUROPEAN COUNTRY IN THE EURO ZONE, THE CURRENT ELECTRONIC DATA
 |_*FROM OECD.STAT HAS BEEN CONVERTED TO EUROS. HOWEVER, WHEN YOU EXTEND YOUR DATA BACK
 |_*TO 1960 USING HARD COPY INFORMATION, THEN IT WILL BE IN NATIONAL CURRENCY UNITS
 |_*RATHER THAN EUROS SO PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT YOU PROPERLY LINK IN THE OLD INFORMATION WITH THE NEW.
 |_*THUS YOU NEED TO COLLECT DATA FOR THE YEARS 1960-1970 FROM THE HARD COPY PUBLICATIONS IN ORDER TO HAVE AN OVERLAP
 |_*YEAR WHICH IS 1970
 |_*V INDICATES A VALUE SERIES IN EITHER EUROS OR THE NATIONAL CURRENCY;
 |_*Q INDICATES CONSTANT PRICE SERIES OR VOLUME SERIES, WHICH WE INTERPRET AS A QUANTITY SERIES
 |_*I AM USING THE CONSTANT PRICE SERIES WITH OECD BASE YEAR BUT YOU COULD USE THE NATIONAL BASE YEAR CONSTANT PRICE
 |_*SERIES IF THE OECD CONSTANT PRICE SERIES IS NOT AVAILABLE. THE END RESULT WILL BE THE SAME.
 |_*SHAZAM REQUIRES THAT THE ULTIMATE DIMENSION OF A VARIABLE IS FIXED WHEN IT IS FIRST DEFINED
 |_*THIS LEADS US TO INITIALLY DEFINE VARIOUS VECTORS AS VECTORS OF 0'S (THIS IS SOMEWHAT ANNOYING)
 |_*THERE ARE 59 YEARS COVERING 1960 T0 2018 SO OUR SERIES WILL BE OF LENGTH 59 AND FOR CAPITAL STOCKS
 |_*THE SERIES MAY BE OF LENGTH 60 (BEGINNING AND END OF YEAR CAPITAL STOCKS)
 |_*SOME OF YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COLLECT DATA FOR 59 YEARS SO YOUR SMPL STATEMENTS WILL BE SHORTER.
 |_*SOME COUNTRIES SIMPLY DO NOT PROVIDE THE OECD WITH UP TO DATE DATA SO FOR SOME OF YOU, YOUR
 |_*OECD STAT SERIES WILL ONLY EXTEND TO 2017. BUT IF YOUR COUNTRY IS AN EU COUNTRY, EUROSTAT WILL PUBLISH
 |_*NATIONAL ACCOUNTS INFORMATION FOR ALL EU COUNTRIES (THEY ARE FORCED TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO EUROSTAT;
 |_*WHILE INFORMATION PROVIDED TO THE OECD IS ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS).
 |_*FOR NON EU COUNTRIES, YOUR COUNTRY WILL HAVE A NATIONAL STATISTICAL AGENCY WEBSITE THAT WILL PROVIDE INFORMATION
 |_*ON THE COUNTRY'S NATIONAL ACCOUNTS PLUS INFORMATION ON LABOUR FORCE ACTIVITY FOR EACH QUARTER. THUS THE NATIONAL
 |_*STATISTICAL AGENCY WILL HAVE INFORMATION FOR 2018; YOU JUST HAVE TO FIND IT! THIS CAN BE A LANGUAGE PROBLEM
 |_*BUT ENGLISH IS SO PERVASIVE THAT MANY NATIONAL STATISTICAL AGENCIES PROVIDE THEIR INFORMATION IN ENGLISH.
 |_*IF THEY DO NOT DO THIS, YOU WILL HAVE TO USE GOOGLE TRANSLATOR OR A SIMILAR PRODUCT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS GOING ON.

 |_*CALLED FINAL CONSUMPTION EXPENDITURE OF HOUSEHOLDS AND NON-PROFIT INSTITUTIONS SERVING HOUSEHOLDS
 |_*THE TABLE IS TABLE 1 IN THE MAIN ANNUAL NATIONAL ACCOUNTS: GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT IS THE TITLE OF THE TABLE

 |_*WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE INVENTORY CHANGE SERIES (WHICH CHANGES SUBSTANTIALLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD), THE
 |_*THE OTHER SERIES MOVE IN A NICE SMOOTH CONTINUOUS MANNER, WHICH IS TO BE EXPECTED.
 |_*AT THIS POINT, MAKE YOUR NEXT STATEMENT "STOP" AND THEN RUN THE PROGRAM
 |_*NOW WE LOAD IN THE CONSTANT DOLLAR DATA FOR THE YEARS 1961-2018 USING THE OECD.STAT DATA
 |_*THE TABLE IN THE MAIN NATIONAL ACCOUNTS IS STILL TABLE 1: GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT; CANADA; BUT NOW INSTEAD OF
 |_*NATIONAL CURRENCY, CURRENT PRICES, WE DOWNLOAD National currency, constant prices, OECD base year
 |_*(ALTERNATIVELY, YOU COULD USE THE national base year TABLE IN OECD.STAT; IT WILL NOT MATTER IN THE END)
 |_*FREQUENCY: ANNUAL; Constant prices, OECD base year
 |_*THE CONSTANT DOLLAR DATA FOR CANADA FROM OECD.STAT IS ONLY AVAILABLE FROM 1970 SO WE WILL LOAD IN THE DATA FOR 1970-2018.
 |_*FOR MOST OECD COUNTRIES, THE DATA WILL ONLY GO BACK TO 1970 SO THE STATEMENTS BELOW FOR QC SHOW YOU HOW TO DEAL WITH
 |_*THIS SITUATION. WE NEED TO CHANGE THE SMPL STATEMENT AT THIS POINT
 |_SMPL 11 59
 |_*QC IS THE SERIES: (FINAL CONSUMPTION EXPENDITURE):
 |_*THE ROW TITLE IS: P31S14_S15: Households and Non-profit institutions serving households
 |_READ QC / BYVAR
    1 VARIABLES AND       49 OBSERVATIONS STARTING AT OBS      11

 |_*FOR THE OTHER FINAL DEMAND COMPONENTS, THE OECD.STAT DATA COVERS THE YEARS 1961-2018 FOR CANADA. FOR MOST OECD COUNTRIES,
 |_*THE DATA WILL ONLY GO BACK TO 1970. THUS FOR THOSE COUNTRIES, DO NOT CHANGE THE SAMPLE STATEMENT AS I WILL DO IN
 |_*THE NEXT LINE.

 |_READ QI1 / BYVAR
    1 VARIABLES AND       58 OBSERVATIONS STARTING AT OBS       2

 |_*THE OECD DOES NOT ALWAYS PROVIDE A CONSTANT DOLLAR SERIES FOR INVENTORY CHANGE SINCE THERE ARE PROBLEMS IN CONSTRUCTING
 |_*QUANTITY INDEXES WHEN THE UNDERLYING VALUE AGGREGATE CHANGES SIGN GOING FROM ONE PERIOD TO THE NEXT.
 |_*THE APPROPRIATE WAY TO DEAL WITH INVENTORY CHANGE IS TO DEFLATE BEGINNING AND END OF PERIOD VALUES OF INVENTORY
 |_*STOCKS AND THEN DIFFERENCE THE RESULTING REAL STOCKS. FOR MORE DETAILS ON THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE WAY NATIONAL
 |_*INCOME ACCOUNTANTS MEASURE REAL INVENTORY CHANGE, SEE: W.E. DIEWERT (2005),“On Measuring Inventory Change in Current and
 |_*Constant Dollars”,Discussion Paper 05-12, Department of Economics, University of British Columbia,Vancouver,B.C.,Canada,V6T 1Z

 |_*WE DO NOT HAVE ESTIMATES FOR THE VALUE OF REAL INVENTORY STOCKS IN GENERAL SO WE WILL SIMPLY USE THE INVESTMENT GOODS
 |_*DEFLATOR (TO BE CONSTRUCTED SHORTLY) TO DEFLATE THE VALUE OF INVENTORY CHANGE.

 |_*FOR CONSUMPTION, WE DO NOT HAVE QC FOR THE YEARS 1960-1969 SO WE CHANGE THE SMPL STATEMENT FROM SMPL 2 58 TO

 |_*WE WILL USE THE INVESTMENT PRICE INDEX TO DEFLATE INVENTORY CHANGE AND THEN ADD THE DEFLATED VALUE OF INVENTORY CHANGE
 |_*TO REAL REPRODUCIBLE INVESTMENT TO OBTAIN OVERALL INVESTMENT. THE USE OF THE INVESTMENT PRICE DEFLATOR TO DEFLATE
 |_*INVENTORY CHANGE IS NOT THE CORRECT DEFLATOR FOR INVENTORIES. BUT IT IS TOO DIFFICULT TO GET THE CORRECT DEFLATOR

 |_*PLEASE CHECK YOUR DATA CAREFULLY FOR DISCONTINUITIES. IF YOU FIND THEM, YOU HAVE PROBABLY MADE A MISTAKE!
 |_***
 |_*IN THE FUTURE I WILL NOT NECESSARILY PRINT OUT THE DATA AT EACH STAGE ALTHOUGH IN FACT AS I WENT THROUGH THE
 |_*PROGRAM, I DID CHECK HOW THE DATA WERE DOING AT EACH STAGE (BUT THEN AFTER CHECKING THE OUTPUT FILE
 |_*I DELETED MANY OF THE PRINT STATEMENTS TO SAVE SPACE). NOTE ALSO THAT I DID NOT ATTEMPT TO
 |_*INPUT ALL OF THE DATA AND THEN RUN THE PROGRAM AT THE VERY END.  WHAT I DID DO IS TO INPUT SOME DATA,
 |_*INSERT A STOP COMMAND AND THEN I RAN THE PROGRAM AT EACH STAGE OF DATA INPUT. YOU SHOULD DO THE SAME!
 |_*NOTE THAT THERE WAS A BIG SURGE IN INFLATION AROUND 1972-1985; THIS WAS TYPICAL FOR OECD COUNTRIES

 |_*THERE REMAINS THE PROBLEM OF OBTAINING INFORMATION ON THE VALUE OF INVENTORY CHANGE FOR THE YEARS 1960-1969
 |_*WE FILL IN THE DATA GAPS FOR VI2 FOR THE YEARS 1960-1969 USING HARD COPIES OF THE OECD NATIONAL ACCOUNTS:
 |_*MAIN AGGREGATES HC79 I5 O751 KOERNER STACKS; I.E., LOOK AT THE TABLE FOR YOUR COUNTRY:
 |_*EXPENDITURE ON THE GDP: AT CURRENT PRICES: INCREASE IN STOCKS
 |_*NOTE: YOU COULD USE THE HARD COPY TO FILL IN THE DATA FOR C, I, G, X AND M FOR THE 1960s BUT I PREFERRED
 |_*TO USE THE INFORMATION IN THE OECD MAIN AGGREGATES; 1960-1997 (1999 EDITION) PUBLICATION BECAUSE THIS
 |_*PUBLICATION IS THE LATEST ONE THAT HAS INFORMATION ON C, I, G, X AND M FOR THE 1960s BUT UNFORTUNATELY
 |_*IT DOES NOT HAVE INFORMATION ON THE VALUE OF INVENTORY CHANGE, OR ON THE COMPENSATION OF EMPLOYEES OR ON DEPRECIATION
 |_*SO WE HAVE TO GO TO THE HARD COPY PUBLICATIONS IN THE LIBRARY TO COLLECT THIS INFORMATION.
 |_*WHEN YOU ARE IN THE LIBRARY, ALSO COLLECT INFORMATION ON THE COMPENSATION OF EMPLOYEES FOR THE 1960'S AND FOR
 |_*THE YEAR 1970.
 |_SMPL 1 11

 |_*NOTE: IT IS BEST TO ALSO COLLECT THE HARD COPY DATA FOR 1970 AS WELL SO THAT YOU CAN COMPARE YOUR HARD COPY
 |_*DATA ON THE VALUE OF INVENTORY CHANGE FOR 1970 WITH THE OECD.STAT DATA FOR 1970
 |_*IF YOUR COUNTRY IS A EURO AREA COUNTRY, THE HARD COPY DATA FOR 1960-1970 WILL BE IN THE OLD DOMESTIC
 |_*CURRENCY WHEREAS THE OECD.STAT DATA WILL BE IN EUROS. THUS YOU NEED TO LINK THE HARD COPY DATA TO
 |_*THE NEWER OECD DATA IN THE SAME WAY THAT WE LINKED IN THE DATA ABOVE FROM THE 1999 EDITION OF THE MAIN AGGREGATES
 |_*TO THE NEWER OECD.STAT DATA.
 |_*FOR CANADA, WE HAVE THE DATA ON INVENTORY CHANGE FOR THE YEARS 1961-2018 SO ALL I NEED FROM THE LIBRARY IS THE
 |_*INFORMATION FOR 1960. HERE IS THE DATA FOR VI2 FROM OECD.STAT FOR THE YEARS 1961-1970

 |_READ VI2 / BYVAR
    1 VARIABLES AND       10 OBSERVATIONS STARTING AT OBS       2

 |_*IT CAN BE SEEN THAT THE OECD.STAT DATA AGREES PRETTY CLOSELY WITH THE OLD HARD COPY DATA. THIS MAY NOT HAPPEN FOR
 |_*YOUR COUNTRY AND IF THIS IS THE CASE, LINK THE HARD COPY DATA TO THE OECD.STAT DATA USING A LINK YEAR.

 |_*PLEASE COLLECT HARD COPY DATA ON THE COMPENSATION OF EMPLOYEES AND ON THE CONSUMPTION OF FIXED CAPITAL (DEPRECIATION)
 |_*FOR THE YEARS 1960-1970 AT THE SAME TIME THAT YOU COLLECT YOUR DATA ON THE INCREASE IN STOCKS AND THE COMPENSATION
 |_*OF EMPLOYEES.

 |_*NOTE THAT CONSUMER PRICES GREW 7.8 FOLD OVER THE SAMPLE PERIOD, THE PRICE OF GOVERNMENT SERVICES GREW
 |_*15.8 FOLD WHILE THE PRICES OF EXPORTS AND IMPORTS GREW 6.8 AND 5.9 FOLD. THIS IS TYPICAL; PG GROWS THE MOST,
 |_*FOLLOWED BY PC AND THEN PX AND PM GROW THE LEAST DUE TO THE EXPANSION OF TRADE OVER THE PERIOD AND THE
 |_*SPECIALIZATION OF EACH COUNTRY IN PRODUCING WHAT CAN BE PRODUCED MOST CHEAPLY IN EACH COUNTRY. WHAT IS
 |_*NOT SO TYPICAL IS THAT THE PRICE OF INVESTMENT GREW 7.3 FOLD BUT NOTE THAT MOST
 |_*OF THE INCREASE IN THE PRICE OF INVESTMENT TOOK PLACE AT THE FIRST HALF OF THE SAMPLE PERIOD BEFORE
 |_*STATISTICS CANADA STARTING QUALITY ADJUSTING COMPUTERS AND OTHER ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS AROUND 1983.
 |_*IN 1983, THE PRICE OF C AND I WERE ROUGHLY THE SAME AND AFTER, INVESTMENT PRICES GREW MUCH MORE SLOWLY
 |_*THAN CONSUMPTION PRICES UNTIL 2004 WHEN PC=6.5 AND PI=5.3.HOWEVER, IN RECENT YEARS, INVESTMENT IN CANADA
 |_*HAS BEEN CONCENTRATED IN STRUCTURES AND SO PI STARTED TO INCREASE MORE THAN PC IN RECENT YEARS AND SO
 |_*PC ENDED UP AT 7.8 IN 2018 AND PI AT 7.3 IN 2018 (SO THE GAP BETWEEN THE INDEXES NARROWED).
 |_*MANY COUNTRIES (GERMANY BEING THE MOST NOTABLE) RESISTED QUALITY ADJUSTING INVESTMENT PRICES UNTIL RELATIVELY
 |_*RECENTLY AND SO THIS CAUSES BIG PROBLEMS IN INTERNATIONAL COMPARABILITY OF DATA ACROSS COUNTRIES.
 |_*CHECK THE ABOVE TABLES CAREFULLY FOR DISCONTINUITIES, WHICH WILL USUALLY MEAN ERRORS!
 |_*THE FACT THAT PG INCREASES THE MOST IS EXPLAINED BY THE FACT THAT GOVT OUTPUT PRICES ARE MEASURED BY THE
 |_*PRICES OF INPUTS USED BY THE GOVT, PRIMARILY LABOUR INPUT PRICES, WHICH ALWAYS GROW RELATIVE TO THE PRICE
 |_*OF CONSUMPTION (I.E., IN ALL OECD COUNTRIES, WE HAVE RISING REAL WAGES OVER THE SAMPLE PERIOD)
 |_*USUALLY THE PRICE OF INVESTMENT GOODS WILL HAVE CLOSE TO THE LOWEST RATE OF GROWTH (AFTER PX AND PM)
 |_*WHICH IS EXPLAINED BY THE FALLING QUALITY ADJUSTED PRICES OF MACHINES, PARTICULARLY THOSE USING COMPUTER CHIPS.
 |_*NOTE THAT THE VALUE OF GOVERNMENT OUTPUT IS MEASURED BY THE VALUE OF GOVERNMENT INPUT COST
 |_*(EXCEPT INPUT COST IS UNDERSTATED BECAUSE THE OPPORTUNITY COST TIED UP IN GOVT CAPITAL IS OMITTED).
 |_*THESE CONVENTIONS USED TO MEASURE GOVERNMENT OUTPUT PRICES AND VALUES ESSENTIALLY MEAN
 |_*THAT PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS IN THE GOVT SECTOR ARE NECESSARILY 0.  HENCE COUNTRIES THAT
 |_*HAVE LARGER GOVT SECTORS WILL NECESSARILY TEND TO HAVE A LOWER PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH RATE, ALL
 |_*OTHER FACTORS EQUAL. MANY OECD CONTRIES HAVE ENORMOUS GOVT SECTORS SO THIS FACT MUST BE KEPT IN MIND.

 |_*THERE WERE 2 OIL SHOCKS IN THE 1970S WHERE THE PRICE OF CRUDE TRIPLED IN EACH SHOCK. THE FIRST SHOCK
 |_*OCCURRED IN 1973-74 AND THE SECOND IN 1979-80. FOR COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TO IMPORT ALL OF THEIR OIL, WE WOULD
 |_*EXPECT THE TERMS OF TRADE TO DROP DURING EACH OF THESE SHOCKS BUT FOR CANADA, THIS DID NOT OCCUR SINCE WE ARE
 |_*BASICALLY AN ENERGY EXPORTER. THERE HAS BEEN A THIRD OIL PRICE SHOCK IN 2007 AND 2008. NOTE THE BIG IMPROVEMENT
 |_*IN CANADA'S TERMS OF TRADE OVER THE YEARS 1999-2011: FROM 1.01 TO 1.24, AN ALMOST 25% IMPROVEMENT.
 |_*AUSTRALIA HAS HAD A SIMILAR IMPROVEMENT IN ITS TERMS OF TRADE.
 |_*IN RECENT YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN BIG CHANGES IN THE PRICE OF OIL BUT SINCE ENERGY INTENSITY HAS DECLINED

 |_*NOTE THAT THE HARD COPY ESTIMATE FOR THE VALUE OF DEPRECIATION IS 10335, WHICH IS SMALLER THAN THE OECD.STAT
 |_*ESTIMATE OF 13866. THIS DISCREPANCY MAY BE DUE TO THE FACT THAT DEPRECIATION WAS NOT WELL MEASURED IN THE 1960S

 |_*PRIVATE BUSINESSES USED, WHICH WERE (AND STILL ARE) BASED ON HISTORICAL COST DEPRECIATION.

 |_*THE PRICE OF CAPITAL HAS DECLINED RELATIVE TO THE PRICE OF GDP OVER TIME AND SO THE NOMINAL CAPITAL OUTPUT
 |_*RATIO, VKYR, HAS FALLEN RELATIVE TO THE REAL CAPITAL OUTPUT RATIO, KYR.
 |_*THE AVERAGE DEPRECIATION RATE IS 7.3% PER YEAR AND THE RATES VARY BETWEEN 6.2% AND 8.4% WHICH IS PRETTY STABLE.
 |_*FOR MOST COUNTRIES, DEPRECIATION RATES SHOULD INCREASE OVER THE SAMPLE PERIOD DUE TO THE GROWTH OF
 |_*HIGH DEPRECIATION MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT RELATIVE TO LOW DEPRECIATION STRUCTURES.HOWEVER, FOR CANADA, THE
 |_*DEPRECIATION RATE HAS DECLINED FROM 8.5% IN 2001 TO 6.8% IN 2018. THIS IS PROBABLY DUE TO THE FACT THAT
 |_*CANADA HAS EXPERIENCED A BIG GROWTH IN HOUSING (STRUCTURE) INVESTMENT, WHICH WILL TEND TO LOWER THE
 |_*OVERALL DEPRECIATION RATE.

 |_*NOTE THAT LABOUR'S SHARE HAS FALLEN FROM 0.552 TO 0.532 OVER THE SAMPLE PERIOD; NOT A HUGE FALL BUT A FALL.
 |_*IN PREVIOUS YEARS, I ASKED STUDENTS TO COMPARE THE ABOVE WAGE RATE SERIES PE WITH THE OECD MANUFACTURING WAGE
 |_*RATE SERIES FOR CANADA. HOWEVER, THE MANUFACTURING WAGE RATE SERIES SHOWS A RATE OF GROWTH OF WAGES THAT
 |_*IS FAR LOWER THAN THE BROADER MEASURE THAT WE HAVE JUST CONSTRUCTED. THUS I NO LONGER ASK STUDENTS TO
 |_*DO THIS COMPARISON SINCE THE MANUFACTURING WAGE RATE IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF ECONOMY WIDE WAGE RATES ANY MORE.

 |_*THE TRENDS IN THE ABOVE TAX RATES ARE QUITE INTERESTING AND SHOW THE SHIFT FROM TAXING CAPITAL TO TAXING LABOUR.
 |_*NOTE ALSO THAT THE IMPORT TAX RATE HAS BEEN STEADILY FALLING.
 |_*WE ALSO NEED TO DEAL WITH SUBSIDIES. THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF SUBSIDY: SUBSIDIES THAT ARE PROPORTIONAL TO OUTPUTS
 |_*PRODUCED BY THE PRODUCTION SECTOR AND SUBSIDIES THAT SIMPLY GIVE LUMP SUM TRANSFERS TO PRODUCERS. THE SECOND
 |_*TYPE OF SUBSIDY ACTS AS A NEGATIVE TAX ON CAPITAL EMPLOYED IN THE PRODUCTION SECTOR; THE FIRST TYPE OF SUBSIDY
 |_*ACTS AS AN INCREASE IN THE SELLING PRICE OF THE SUBSIDIZED OUTPUTS PRODUCED BY THE SUBSIDIZED INDUSTRIES.
 |_*WE WILL MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT TO SELLING PRICES DUE TO THE FIRST TYPE OF SUBSIDY.
 |_*WE CAN DOWNLOAD ESTIMATES FOR THE VALUE OF SUBSIDIES ON PRODUCTS FROM OECD.STAT FOR THE YEARS 1970-2017

 |_*NOTE THAT THE SUBSIDY RATE TAKES A JUMP GOING FROM 1973 TO 1974 (AS DID THE EXPORT TAX). AT THIS TIME OUR FIRST
 |_*TRUDEAU PRIME MINISTER INTRODUCED ALL KINDS OF CRAZY POLICIES THAT DISTORTED THE ECONOMY TO A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE.
 |_*NOTE THAT TAXES ROSE RAPIDLY IN THE 1970s AS ENTITLEMENTS GREATLY EXPANDED THEN.
 |_*NOTE ALSO THAT THE CAPITAL TAX RATE IS THE CAPITAL STOCK TAX RATE; WE WILL WORK OUT THE CAPITAL INCOME TAX RATE SHORTLY.
 |_*FINALLY NOTE THE DROP IN IMPORT TAXES OVER THE SAMPLE PERIOD.
 |_*NOW WE CAN GENR GROSS PROFITS (OR GROSS RETURN TO CAPITAL) USING PRODUCER PRICES.

 |_*THESE NOMINAL EX POST RATES OF RETURN R ARE VERY HIGH DUE TO THE FACT THAT WE ARE NEGLECTING LAND AND OTHER
 |_*ASSETS LIKE NATURAL RESOURCE STOCKS IN OUR ASSET BASE.
 |_*NOTE THAT WE ARE INCLUDING EX POST ASSET CAPITAL GAINS AS PART OF THE RETURN TO CAPITAL AND SO IN YEARS
 |_*WHEN ASSET INFLATION IK IS HIGH, THE EX POST RATE OF R IS ALSO VERY HIGH.
 |_*THE ABOVE METHODOLOGY IS REASONABLE IF WE WANT TO DETERMINE RATES OF RETURN ON CAPITAL ASSUMING THAT

 |_*THE SMOOTHING PARAMETER IS THE FRACTION OF THE SAMPLE THAT IS USED IN A WEIGHTED LOCAL REGRESSION TO
 |_*PREDICT A DEPENDENT VARIABLE USING THE X OBSERVATIONS THAT ARE CLOSEST TO THE X FOR A GIVEN OBSERVATION.
 |_*THE METHOD IS DUE TO W.S. CLEVELAND (1979),"Robust Locally Weighted Regression and Smoothing Scatterplots",
 |_*Journal of the American Statistical Association 74, 829-836. THE SMALLER IS THIS FRACTION, THE FEWER
 |_*LOCAL OBSERVATIONS ARE USED IN THE LOCAL REGRESSIONS. THE CROSS VALIDATION SCORE IS A MEASURE OF HOW
 |_*WELL THE METHOD PREDICTS EACH OBSERVATION SO THE LOWER THE SCORE, THE BETTER ARE THE PREDICTIONS. I
 |_*AM RELUCTANT TO DECREASE THE SMOOTHING PARAMETER BELOW .13, BECAUSE LOWER SMOOTHS WILL MAKE THE R SQUARE
 |_*CLOSER TO 1 AND HENCE, WE ARE NOT DOING MUCH SMOOTHING. THUS I WILL TAKE IKS13 AS MY PREDICTED CAPITAL
 |_*PRICE INFLATION RATE SERIES.

 |_*IT IS ALSO USEFUL TO CALCULATE REAL RATES OF RETURN FOR THE CANADIAN ECONOMY.
 |_*TO CALCULATE REAL RATES OF RETURN, WE NEED CONSUMER PRICE INDEX INFLATION RATES
 |_*GO TO THE OECD TABLE IN THE PRICES TABLES: Dataset: Consumer price indices (CPIs) - Complete database

 |_*I SENT YOU THIS TABLE. DOWNLOAD THE DATA FOR YOUR COUNTRY FOR THE 60 YEARS 1959-2018
 |_*NOTE: FOR SOME COUNTRIES, THE CPI DATA ARE INCOMPLETE. AND FOR HIGH INFLATION COUNTRIES, THE EARLY YEARS
 |_*DATA DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH SIGNIFICANT DIGITS. TO FILL IN THE MISSING YEARS, YOU COULD TRY TO GO TO THE
 |_*COUNTRY'S NATIONAL STATISTICAL AGENCY (OR LOOK AT OTHER SOURCES FOR CONSUMER PRICE INDEX DATA LIKE
 |_*THE IMF OR THE UN). OR YOU COULD USE YOUR PC SERIES AND LINK IT TO THE OECD CPI SERIES. WE DO NOT HAVE
 |_*PC FOR 1959 BUT YOU COULD COLLECT THIS INFORMATION FROM THE HARD COPIES OF THE OECD MAIN NATIONAL ACCOUNTS
 |_*WHEN YOU LOOK UP YOUR DATA FOR THE 1960S.

 |_*THE AVERAGE (SMOOTHED) NOMINAL RATE OF RETURN ON CAPITAL STOCK ASSETS R IS 14.2% PER YEAR AND THE AVERAGE REAL RATE OF
 |_*RETURN RR IS 10.1%. THESE RATES ARE OVERSTATED DUE TO OUR NEGLECT OF LAND, INVENTORY AND NATURAL RESOURCE ASSETS IN OUR
 |_*ASSET BASE.OUR SLIGHTLY SMOOTHED REAL RATE OF RETURN SERIES, RR, IS AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR OF THE EFFICIENCY OF AN ECONOMY.
 |_*IT CAN BE SEEN THAT THIS RATE WAS 17.0% IN 2006 AND HAS BEEN TRENDING DOWNWARD SINCE 2006 TO FINISH UP AT 8.52% IN 2018.
 |_*IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW RR WORKS OUT FOR YOUR COUNTRY!
 |_*NOTE ALSO THAT THIS IS A BEFORE TAX RATE OF RETURN AND THE AVERAGE ASSET TAX RATE IS 3.6% SO THE AVERAGE
 |_*AFTER TAX REAL RATE OF RETURN IS ONLY 6.5% (WHICH IS STILL TOO HIGH BECAUSE OF THE NARROW ASSET BASE).

 |_*THUS REAL WAGES IN CANADA GREW ABOUT 2.66 FOLD OVER THE SAMPLE PERIOD. MOST OECD COUNTRIES ACHIEVED MUCH
 |_*HIGHER RATES OF GROWTH OF REAL WAGES. PART OF THE SLOW GROWTH IN REAL WAGES IS DUE TO THE RELATIVELY

 |_*THE AVERAGE RATE OF TFP GROWTH IN THE 1960'S WAS 2.20% PER YEAR WHICH IS VERY GOOD. MOST OECD COUNTRIES
 |_*HAD VERY HIGH RATES OF TFP GROWTH IN THE 1960S, WHICH TAILED OFF IN SUBSEQUENT DECADES. WHY IS THIS?
 |_*THIS IS STILL A PUZZLE. THE HIGH UNANTICIPATED INFLATION WHICH STARTED IN 1973 IS ONE POSSIBLE EXPLANATORY
 |_*FACTOR. THIS CAN LEAD TO HIGH REAL INTEREST RATES WHICH PERSISTED UNTIL THE MIDDLE OF THE 1990S.
 |_*THERE DOES SEEM TO BE MORE TFP GROWTH WHEN INFLATION IS LOW. WHY? PERHAPS DUE TO THE BUSINESS INCOME TAXATION SYSTEM
 |_*WHICH DOES NOT INDEX DEPRECIATION ALLOWANCES FOR INFLATION.ANOTHER THEORY LOOKS AT THE GROWTH OF THE
 |_*GOVERNMENT SECTOR WHICH TOOK PLACE IN THE 1970S AND 1980S WHICH WERE ACCOMPANIED BY HIGHER TAXES AND HENCE
 |_*MORE DEADWEIGHT LOSS. ALSO, REMEMBER THAT THE GOVT SECTOR WILL NOT SHOW ANY PRODUCTIVITY INCREASES DUE
 |_*TO NATIONAL INCOME ACCOUNTING CONVENTIONS SO THE LARGER GOVT SECTORS WILL NATURALLY LEAD TO LOWER TFP GROWTH.
 |_*RECALL THAT GOVT STATISTICIANS DO NOT COUNT ANY INTEREST ON GOV CAPITAL AS PART OF INPUT SO THIS WILL
 |_*ALSO BE MISSING FROM THE VALUE OF GOVT OUTPUT. BUT OUR IMPUTATION METHOD HAS IMPUTED AN INTEREST RATE TO GOVT CAPITAL
 |_*AS PART OF INPUT. SO OUR METHODOLOGY MAY LEAD TO MEASURED PRODUCTIVITY DECREASES AS THE SIZE
 |_*OF THE GOVT SECTOR INCREASES. A FINAL EXPLANATORY FACTOR HAS TO DO WITH THE MOVEMENT OF ECONOMIES AWAY FROM GOODS
 |_*TO SERVICES, WHICH ARE HARDER TO MEASURE; E.G., BANKING SECTOR OUTPUT, INSURANCE, GAMBLING, ADVERTISING, TELECOM, ETC.
 |_*MANY RESEARCHERS (INCLUDING DIEWERT AND FOX) FEEL THAT THERE IS UNDERMEASUREMENT OF OUTPUT DUE TO THIS FACTOR.
