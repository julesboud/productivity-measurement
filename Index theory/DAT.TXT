*THIS IS THE FILE DAT.TXT WHICH CONSTRUCTS THE CANADIAN DATA FOR 1960-2018.  
*DATA CONSTRUCTED JUNE 2, 2019.
*WHEN A LINE HAS AN * IN THE FIRST POSITION, SHAZAM IGNORES THE RESULTING STATEMENT
*BUT THESE STATEMENTS WITH A * EXPLAIN WHAT THE PROGRAM IS TRYING TO DO.WHEN YOU HAVE A JOB AS AN ECONOMIST,
*YOU WILL HAVE TO DOCUMENT YOUR PROGRAMS. THE * MATERIAL ENABLES YOU TO EXPLAIN TO OTHERS (AND YOURSELF)
*WHAT YOU ARE DOING IN THE PROGRAM. DOCUMENTATION OF YOUR PROGRAM IS OF PRIMARY IMPORTANCE IN THE REAL WORLD.
*I HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN WHAT THE PROGRAM IS TRYING TO DO IN THESE STATEMENTS PRECEDED BY AN *
*I HAVE USED INFORMATION FROM OECD.STAT PLUS SOME EARLIER OECD HARD COPY PUBLICATIONS IN 
*ORDER TO GENERATE DATA FOR THE 1960S PLUS SOME STATISTICS CANADA INFORMATION TO UPDATE THE DATA TO 2016.
*THE OUTPUT FILE IS SHAZAMW\E59419\DATOUT.TXT. YOUR TITLES FOR THE INPUT AND OUTPUT FILES WILL BE DIFFERENT.
*NATIONAL ACOUNTS DATA ARE AVAILABLE IN VARIOUS LIBRARY PUBLICATIONS; SEE
*MAIN AGGREGATES: 1960-1997; OECD; PARIS; 1999 (HC 79 I5 O751 ) (I WILL MAKE AN ELECTRONIC COPY AVAILABLE FOR YOU). 
*TO GET SOME INFORMATION FOR THE 1960S, YOU WILL NEED TO GO TO THE UBC LIBRARY AND SEARCH FOR HARD COPIES
*OF THE OECD MAIN AGGREGATES FOR THE 1970s WHICH HAVE ANNUAL DATA FOR THE 1960s IN THEM.
*HOWEVER THE MAIN AGGREGATES: 1960-1997; OECD; PARIS; 1999 VOLUME HAS INFORMATION ON 
*C+G+I+X-M IN CURRENT AND CONSTANT DOLLARS FOR THE 1960'S.
*THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE A EUROPEAN COUNTRY IN THE EURO ZONE, THE CURRENT ELECTRONIC DATA
*FROM OECD.STAT HAS BEEN CONVERTED TO EUROS. HOWEVER, WHEN YOU EXTEND YOUR DATA BACK 
*TO 1960 USING HARD COPY INFORMATION, THEN IT WILL BE IN NATIONAL CURRENCY UNITS
*RATHER THAN EUROS SO PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT YOU PROPERLY LINK IN THE OLD INFORMATION WITH THE NEW.
*THUS YOU NEED TO COLLECT DATA FOR THE YEARS 1960-1970 FROM THE HARD COPY PUBLICATIONS IN ORDER TO HAVE AN OVERLAP
*YEAR WHICH IS 1970
*V INDICATES A VALUE SERIES IN EITHER EUROS OR THE NATIONAL CURRENCY;
*Q INDICATES CONSTANT PRICE SERIES OR VOLUME SERIES, WHICH WE INTERPRET AS A QUANTITY SERIES
*I AM USING THE CONSTANT PRICE SERIES WITH OECD BASE YEAR BUT YOU COULD USE THE NATIONAL BASE YEAR CONSTANT PRICE
*SERIES IF THE OECD CONSTANT PRICE SERIES IS NOT AVAILABLE. THE END RESULT WILL BE THE SAME. 
*SHAZAM REQUIRES THAT THE ULTIMATE DIMENSION OF A VARIABLE IS FIXED WHEN IT IS FIRST DEFINED
*THIS LEADS US TO INITIALLY DEFINE VARIOUS VECTORS AS VECTORS OF 0'S (THIS IS SOMEWHAT ANNOYING) 
*THERE ARE 59 YEARS COVERING 1960 T0 2018 SO OUR SERIES WILL BE OF LENGTH 59 AND FOR CAPITAL STOCKS
*THE SERIES MAY BE OF LENGTH 60 (BEGINNING AND END OF YEAR CAPITAL STOCKS)
*SOME OF YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COLLECT DATA FOR 59 YEARS SO YOUR SMPL STATEMENTS WILL BE SHORTER.
*SOME COUNTRIES SIMPLY DO NOT PROVIDE THE OECD WITH UP TO DATE DATA SO FOR SOME OF YOU, YOUR
*OECD STAT SERIES WILL ONLY EXTEND TO 2017. BUT IF YOUR COUNTRY IS AN EU COUNTRY, EUROSTAT WILL PUBLISH
*NATIONAL ACCOUNTS INFORMATION FOR ALL EU COUNTRIES (THEY ARE FORCED TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO EUROSTAT;
*WHILE INFORMATION PROVIDED TO THE OECD IS ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS). 
*FOR NON EU COUNTRIES, YOUR COUNTRY WILL HAVE A NATIONAL STATISTICAL AGENCY WEBSITE THAT WILL PROVIDE INFORMATION
*ON THE COUNTRY'S NATIONAL ACCOUNTS PLUS INFORMATION ON LABOUR FORCE ACTIVITY FOR EACH QUARTER. THUS THE NATIONAL
*STATISTICAL AGENCY WILL HAVE INFORMATION FOR 2018; YOU JUST HAVE TO FIND IT! THIS CAN BE A LANGUAGE PROBLEM
*BUT ENGLISH IS SO PERVASIVE THAT MANY NATIONAL STATISTICAL AGENCIES PROVIDE THEIR INFORMATION IN ENGLISH.
*IF THEY DO NOT DO THIS, YOU WILL HAVE TO USE GOOGLE TRANSLATOR OR A SIMILAR PRODUCT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS GOING ON.

*THE OECD DOES NOT ALWAYS PROVIDE A CONSTANT DOLLAR SERIES FOR INVENTORY CHANGE SINCE THERE ARE PROBLEMS IN CONSTRUCTING 
*QUANTITY INDEXES WHEN THE UNDERLYING VALUE AGGREGATE CHANGES SIGN GOING FROM ONE PERIOD TO THE NEXT.

*CHECK THE ABOVE TABLES CAREFULLY FOR DISCONTINUITIES, WHICH WILL USUALLY MEAN ERRORS!

*PRICES OF INPUTS USED BY THE GOVT, PRIMARILY LABOUR INPUT PRICES, WHICH ALWAYS GROW RELATIVE TO THE PRICE 
*OF CONSUMPTION (I.E., IN ALL OECD COUNTRIES, WE HAVE RISING REAL WAGES OVER THE SAMPLE PERIOD)
*USUALLY THE PRICE OF INVESTMENT GOODS WILL HAVE CLOSE TO THE LOWEST RATE OF GROWTH (AFTER PX AND PM)

*NOTE THAT THE VALUE OF GOVERNMENT OUTPUT IS MEASURED BY THE VALUE OF GOVERNMENT INPUT COST
*(EXCEPT INPUT COST IS UNDERSTATED BECAUSE THE OPPORTUNITY COST TIED UP IN GOVT CAPITAL IS OMITTED).

*EXPECT THE TERMS OF TRADE TO DROP DURING EACH OF THESE SHOCKS BUT FOR CANADA, THIS DID NOT OCCUR SINCE WE ARE
*BASICALLY AN ENERGY EXPORTER. THERE HAS BEEN A THIRD OIL PRICE SHOCK IN 2007 AND 2008. NOTE THE BIG IMPROVEMENT

*THE AVERAGE RATE OF TFP GROWTH IN THE 1960'S WAS 2.20% PER YEAR WHICH IS VERY GOOD. MOST OECD COUNTRIES
*HAD VERY HIGH RATES OF TFP GROWTH IN THE 1960S, WHICH TAILED OFF IN SUBSEQUENT DECADES. WHY IS THIS?
*THIS IS STILL A PUZZLE. THE HIGH UNANTICIPATED INFLATION WHICH STARTED IN 1973 IS ONE POSSIBLE EXPLANATORY
*FACTOR. THIS CAN LEAD TO HIGH REAL INTEREST RATES WHICH PERSISTED UNTIL THE MIDDLE OF THE 1990S.
*THERE DOES SEEM TO BE MORE TFP GROWTH WHEN INFLATION IS LOW. WHY? PERHAPS DUE TO THE BUSINESS INCOME TAXATION SYSTEM
*WHICH DOES NOT INDEX DEPRECIATION ALLOWANCES FOR INFLATION.ANOTHER THEORY LOOKS AT THE GROWTH OF THE 
*GOVERNMENT SECTOR WHICH TOOK PLACE IN THE 1970S AND 1980S WHICH WERE ACCOMPANIED BY HIGHER TAXES AND HENCE
*MORE DEADWEIGHT LOSS. ALSO, REMEMBER THAT THE GOVT SECTOR WILL NOT SHOW ANY PRODUCTIVITY INCREASES DUE
*TO NATIONAL INCOME ACCOUNTING CONVENTIONS SO THE LARGER GOVT SECTORS WILL NATURALLY LEAD TO LOWER TFP GROWTH.
*RECALL THAT GOVT STATISTICIANS DO NOT COUNT ANY INTEREST ON GOV CAPITAL AS PART OF INPUT SO THIS WILL
*ALSO BE MISSING FROM THE VALUE OF GOVT OUTPUT. BUT OUR IMPUTATION METHOD HAS IMPUTED AN INTEREST RATE TO GOVT CAPITAL 
*AS PART OF INPUT. SO OUR METHODOLOGY MAY LEAD TO MEASURED PRODUCTIVITY DECREASES AS THE SIZE
*OF THE GOVT SECTOR INCREASES. A FINAL EXPLANATORY FACTOR HAS TO DO WITH THE MOVEMENT OF ECONOMIES AWAY FROM GOODS
*TO SERVICES, WHICH ARE HARDER TO MEASURE; E.G., BANKING SECTOR OUTPUT, INSURANCE, GAMBLING, ADVERTISING, TELECOM, ETC.
*MANY RESEARCHERS (INCLUDING DIEWERT AND FOX) FEEL THAT THERE IS UNDERMEASUREMENT OF OUTPUT DUE TO THIS FACTOR.

*NOW CONSTRUCT SOME DATA FILES FOR LATER ECONOMETRIC ESTIMATION EXERCISES
*SET UP A PRODUCER DATA FILE FOR RUNNING THE PMOD.TXT REGRESSIONS AND FOR DOING A PRODUCTIVITY DECOMPOSITION 
*INTO EXPLANATORY FACTORS AS IS DONE IN DIEWERT AND MORRISON, ECONOMIC JOURNAL, 1986
*FOR OUR FIRST FILE, WE WILL HAVE C,I,G,X,-M AND -L AS VARIABLE NET OUTPUTS AND K AS THE FIXED INPUT
