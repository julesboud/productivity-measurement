Intro
Will often make comparisons with Canada because (1. Country you know, 2. Similar small open economies, but the differences are interesting)
Question (1) we want to solve: why is Australian growth faster than Canadian growth (3.5% vs 3% avg between 1960 and 1970, technology?, inputs?, TOT?).
Change in TOT have major implications for economy. 
Main exports: (https://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/aus/)
Top trading partners.
Resource based. World bank: 10% of GDP coming from natural resource rents (2nd highest in OECD after Norway). Canada is 5%. So twice as resource-intensive economy.

Question(2) : Stable growth. No recession in last 30 years. Longest run of uninterrupted GDP growth in the developed world
Timeline graph (https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/438566/timeline-shared-in-several-beamer-frames). Do it by decades instead.


Graphs I will show are relative, we are more interested in growth/changes than absolute numbers
I won't show every single measure we derived in the programs, but these are graphed in the Appendix if you have any questions about them.
Data (Compare to Canada?)
1. Outputs
	GDP components
	Prices (relative)
	GDP (Compared to Canada)
	TOT (combine with technology to see effect of these on GDP?)
2. Inputs
	Real Wages (and PL? and PK?) Do I really need real wages? Confusing more than anything.
	Employment (average hours worked)
	Taxes
	KYR compared to Canada (even though I start higher at 3% you still have faster growth in investment?)
	RR vs Canada (also ex-post asset inflation?)
	Labour shares at producer prices
	Index theory productivity
Finish with short conclusion
